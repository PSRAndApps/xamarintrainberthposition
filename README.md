Indian Train Berth Reservation Scenario: You have to book ticket long before your journey else you may end up with some waiting list and if you are lucky you will get the berth. But problem arises here is, you berth preference may not match with the actual berth/seat allocated to you. That to, when your PNR was in waiting list and when it gets confirmed. You might be thinking of which berth position you got. Sometimes, your parents or children berth position matters to you. According to the berth position, you may plan the packing things.

I have thought of this and just created a single page offline mobile application which is freely distributed in market, when I found very good response to my blogpost "Know Your Indian Train Berth Positioin".
